This is a disassembler it takes 1's and 0's and converts them to ARMv8 code.


How to run: 

In the linux comand line with all the files in the same folder run:
	python3 team4_project1.py -i test3a_bin.txt -o team4_out
if you run with python(2.7) not python3 it will say that print() is not vaild becuase python(2.7) thinks that you are trying to print("something") not call the function print() from the disassembler.py

YaY you did it :)
